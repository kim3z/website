<p class="has-medium-font-size">I have now been working at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/genero-digital-agency/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Genero</a>&nbsp;for about half a year. During the summer I worked as Developer Trainee back in my hometown, it was a great summer. After that it was time to move back to Vaasa to begin my fourth year at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/school/univaasa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">univaasa</a>. The only difference now is that I&#8217;m a M.Sc. student studying a combination of Automation and Software Engineering. It&#8217;s nice to focus on software and automation after three years of studying Information Technology (B.Sc.) where I learned a lot about different kinds of engineering: energy, electrical, automation and software engineering.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">After the summer I signed a new contract with Genero, so now I work as remote developer (part-time) while studying. I&#8217;m so blessed and thankful for the opportunities they have given me. Working part time as a remote developer has allowed me to focus on my education while getting valuable work experience besides studying. As my schedule varies a lot it&#8217;s common to have a free period during a day at university when I&#8217;m able to work for a couple of hours, and some days I might not even have any lectures at all. Genero really makes sure that I get to focus and prioritise school, and that I get to make my own schedule for when I&#8217;m working each week. I really appreciate how often they ask me how school is going, it feels good that they care.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Working while studying is a lot of fun, because I get to work on real projects and use the skills and knowledge I have learned from previous work experience and also from studying. At Genero learning new things is valued a lot, so if you know something that the others don&#8217;t, you are more than welcome to teach it.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">It&#8217;s nice to be able to work from anywhere, usually it&#8217;s at the library, coffee shop or some other cool place at university while I wait for my next lecture. And if I don&#8217;t have any free periods during a school day I work either before or after school in my apartment. I have a decent monitor, desk and office chair where I can comfortably sit and work for a whole day at home.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Although this all sounds nice and fun, I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s easy either. Working remotely while studying requires discipline, planning, communication and trust. It&#8217;s important to plan each week carefully, so that both you and your team knows when you are working and when you aren&#8217;t. This makes it a lot easier for yourself to know when to focus on school and when to focus on work, and after the planning it&#8217;s important to have the discipline to take action on those plans! Planning each week carefully makes it a lot easier for your team to know when you&#8217;re working and to manage projects. Everything I just mentioned is important, but to make anything work at all it&#8217;s important to build trust between the employer and employee. Without trust this wouldn&#8217;t be possible at all, trust is something to value.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">So I want to say a big thank you to Genero and my awesome colleagues, none of this would be possible without you.</p>
